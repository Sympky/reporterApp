# Security Report Structure Guide

This document outlines the standards for creating security assessment reports in our platform. Following these guidelines ensures consistency, professionalism, and maximum value for clients.

## Document Structure & Organization

### Use a Consistent Hierarchy

Every report must include these core sections in order:

1. **Executive Summary**
2. **Introduction**
3. **Methodology**
4. **Findings**
5. **Remediation Recommendations**
6. **Appendices**

### Executive Summary (1-2 pages)

The executive summary should:
- Provide a high-level overview of key findings
- Include a risk assessment summary
- List high-priority recommendations
- Be written for executives who may not read the detailed report
- Avoid technical jargon and focus on business impact

### Findings Matrix

Include a comprehensive table that shows:
- All identified vulnerabilities
- Severity ratings
- Affected systems
- Remediation difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard)
- Recommended timeline for addressing each issue

### Vulnerability Categorization

Group similar findings together into categories such as:
- Authentication and Authorization Issues
- Injection Vulnerabilities
- Configuration Weaknesses
- Encryption Problems
- Access Control Issues
- Input Validation Flaws

### Consistent Finding Template

Each vulnerability must follow this structure:

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Title | Clear, descriptive name of the vulnerability |
| Severity | Critical, High, Medium, Low, or Informational |
| Affected Components | List of specific systems, applications, or services affected |
| Description | Technical explanation of the vulnerability |
| Proof of Concept | Evidence demonstrating how the vulnerability was confirmed |
| Impact | Business and technical impact if exploited |
| Remediation Steps | Clear instructions for fixing the issue |

## Visual Design Elements

### Color Palette

Use a professional, conservative color scheme:
- Primary colors: Navy blue, dark gray, white
- Accent colors: Only for severity indicators or highlighting critical information
- Avoid bright or unprofessional colors

### Severity Indicators

Use standard color-coding for findings:
- Critical: Red (#FF0000)
- High: Orange (#FF7F00)
- Medium: Yellow (#FFFF00)
- Low: Blue (#0000FF)
- Informational: Green (#00FF00)

### Font Selection

Limit to two complementary fonts:
- Headings: Georgia (serif)
- Body text: Calibri or Arial (sans-serif)
- Font sizes: 18pt for major headings, 14pt for subheadings, 11pt for body text

### Risk Heat Map

Include a visual risk heat map that plots:
- X-axis: Impact severity
- Y-axis: Likelihood or frequency
- Size of markers: Number of findings in each category

### Screenshot Guidelines

- Include clear, annotated screenshots as evidence
- Add highlights, arrows, or boxes to direct attention to relevant areas
- Properly redact sensitive information (credentials, personal data, internal IPs)
- Keep screenshot sizes reasonable (no larger than necessary to show the issue)

## Charts & Visualizations

### Required Visualizations

#### Vulnerability Distribution Charts
- Pie chart showing findings by severity
- Bar chart showing findings by category
- Distribution chart showing affected systems

#### Attack Path Diagrams
For complex environments, include flow charts showing:
- Potential attack paths
- Vulnerability chaining opportunities
- Critical assets at risk

#### Network Topology Diagrams
Include simplified network diagrams:
- Highlight assessment scope
- Mark vulnerable components
- Show network segmentation

#### Remediation Timeline
Provide Gantt charts or similar visuals for:
- Suggested remediation timelines
- Prioritization based on severity and difficulty
- Resource allocation recommendations

#### Trend Analysis
For recurring assessments:
- Show improvement or regression over time
- Track closed vs. new findings
- Illustrate security posture changes

## Professional Best Practices

### Audience-Appropriate Language
- Executive sections: Business-focused, non-technical language
- Technical sections: Precise terminology appropriate for IT professionals
- Avoid unexplained acronyms and jargon

### Verification Steps
For each vulnerability:
- Provide clear steps to reproduce the issue
- Include commands, tools, or procedures needed for verification
- Note any special requirements or prerequisites

### Realistic Remediation Options
Offer multiple solution approaches:
- Quick fixes for immediate risk reduction
- Long-term strategic solutions
- Consider client resources and constraints
- Include estimated effort levels

### Technical Appendices
Move detailed technical information to appendices:
- Lengthy code samples
- Detailed logs
- Step-by-step testing procedures
- Tool configurations

### Testing Coverage Documentation
Clearly document:
- What was tested
- What wasn't tested (and why)
- Testing limitations
- Any scope changes during assessment
- Assumptions made during testing
